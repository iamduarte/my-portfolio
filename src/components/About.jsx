            Originally hailing from the south of Portugal, I spent 7 solid years
            in the world of mechanical engineering.
            <br />
            However, curiosity led me down a new path so I&apos;ve recently
            dived into the captivating realm of software development.
            <br />
            Always eager to learn and adapt, keen to grow, learn, and be part of
            impactful projects, I&apos;m on the lookout for opportunities to
            further hone my developer skills.
